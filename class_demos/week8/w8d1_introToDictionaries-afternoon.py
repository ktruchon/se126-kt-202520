#W8D1 - Introduction to Dictionaries

#Dictionaries in Python are a collection set similar to associative arrays in JavaScript but also look similar to JS object builds. Most importantly, they store data in key and value pairs. They keys are referred to as properties and the values can be any data type.

#---MAIN EXECUTING CODE-----------------------------------------

#start by creating a populated dictionary 
myCar = {
    #'key' : value,
    "make": "Ford",
    "model": "Focus SE Hatchback",
    "year" : 2014,
    "name": "Gwendoline",
    "color" : "black",
    #key names CANNOT be repeated / NO DUPLICATES of keys! 
    "color" : "red"
}

#view the entire dictionary and all of its data
print(myCar)

#view a specifc value from the dictionary --> name[key] --> value
print(f"My car is a {myCar["make"]} {myCar["model"]}. It is {myCar["color"]}.")

yourCar = {
    #'key' : value,
    "make": "Ford",
    "model": "F-150",
    "year" : 2024,
    "name": "Gandalf",
    "color" : "black",
    "friends" : ["Tyler", "Tony", "Steve"]
}

print(f"My car is a {yourCar["make"]} {yourCar["model"]}. It is {yourCar["color"]}.")

#add some data to a dictionary once created
yourCar["plate"] = "12345"

#or use the .update({key:value}) method
yourCar.update({"wheels" : "4"})

for key in yourCar:
    #for every key stored to the yourCar dictionary
    print(f"{key.upper():10}\t{yourCar[key]}")
