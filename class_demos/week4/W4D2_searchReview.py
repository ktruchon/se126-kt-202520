#W4D2 - Sequential Search Review + Creating & Writing to Text Files

#PROGRAM PROMPT: In the W4D2 demo, we will review utilizing sequential search for simple singular and multi returns. We will then create and write data to a text file using Python.

#--IMPORTS----------------------------------------------------------------
import csv
#--FUNCTIONS--------------------------------------------------------------

#--MAIN EXECUTING CODE----------------------------------------------------

#creating empty lists - one for each field 
dragons = []        #field0
riders = []         #field1
count = []          #field2 *
color1 = []         #field3
color2 = []         #field4

with open("text_files/dragons.csv") as csvfile:
    file = csv.reader(csvfile)

    for rec in file:
        dragons.append(rec[0])
        riders.append(rec[1])
        count.append(rec[2])
        color1.append(rec[3])

        if rec[2] == "2":
            color2.append(rec[4])

            color2.append("---")
        else:
            color2.append("ERROR")
#disconnected from file ----------------------------

#process the lists to diplay data to the console
