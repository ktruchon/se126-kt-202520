#W4D1 - Sequential Search

#PROGRAM PROMPT: We will continue to work with the class_grades.csv file, as used in the W3D2 demo. We will practice connecting to a file, storing the file data into parallel lists, and creating new data for each student record based on these lists. We will then build a sequential search program which will allow us to find students in the file, and write data regarding them to a newly created file in our repository.

#this file uses: class_grades.csv
